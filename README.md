# Near Cashback smart-contract

# Rocketo Challenge

We have integrated Rocketo in our system.
So the flow works like that:
1. When user grab his casback second time we give him 50% via QR-code casback and other 50% of cashback we put on deposit in our smart-contract.
2. Next time when user grab QR-code from the same shop we put 50% of cashback again and again before we will not have enough money to create a stream on Rocketo and some money for streaming. So > 0.2 Near.
3. Then when the amount of cashback on our deposit is enough we start the stream. And on each claim from the same shop we top up the stream so increase the value of paying in the same shop/SME.
4.
